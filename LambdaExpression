Quick Answer:
 Lambda Expressions in Java 8 are anonymous functions that let you treat behavior as data. They simplify code, reduce boilerplate, and integrate seamlessly with functional interfaces like Runnable, Comparator, and Predicate.

🔑 Core Details of Lambda Expressions
Introduced in Java 8 to support functional programming.
Syntax:
 (parameters) -> expression_or_block


Requirements: Must be used with a functional interface (an interface with a single abstract method, e.g., Runnable, Callable, Comparator).
Purpose:
Pass code as arguments.
Write concise, readable logic.
Avoid anonymous inner classes.

📘 Multiple Examples
1. Simple Arithmetic
interface Add {
    int addition(int a, int b);
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Add add = (a, b) -> a + b;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + add.addition(10, 20));
    }
}

👉 Output: Sum: 30

2. Runnable with Lambda
Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Running in a thread!");
new Thread(r).start();

👉 Eliminates verbose anonymous inner classes.

3. Iterating Collections
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Sagar", "Copilot", "Java");
names.forEach(n -> System.out.println(n));

👉 Output: Prints each name.

4. Comparator for Sorting
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Sagar", "Copilot", "Java");
Collections.sort(names, (a, b) -> a.compareTo(b));
System.out.println(names);

👉 Output: [Copilot, Java, Sagar].

5. Stream API with Lambda
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream()
                 .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                 .mapToInt(n -> n)
                 .sum();
System.out.println("Sum of even numbers: " + sum);

👉 Output: Sum of even numbers: 6.

6. Predicate Example
Predicate<String> startsWithS = s -> s.startsWith("S");
System.out.println(startsWithS.test("Sagar")); // true
System.out.println(startsWithS.test("Java"));  // false

⚡ Why It Matters for You
Sagar, since you’re already building Salesforce LWCs, lambdas are conceptually similar to inline event handlers (onclick={handleClick}), but with the added power of passing logic directly into APIs like Streams. This makes them perfect for dynamic data filtering and transformation, much like how you use SOQL queries with Apex.
👉 Would you like me to create a side-by-side comparison of traditional for-loops vs lambdas/streams? That’s often the clearest way to see their real-world impact.
